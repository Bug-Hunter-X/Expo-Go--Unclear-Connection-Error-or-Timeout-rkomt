The solution is straightforward: restart the Expo Go app.  If this doesn't work, try rebuilding the project. The code itself isn't faulty; the problem is a synchronization issue between Expo Go and the development server. This is a known limitation with Expo Go; Expo CLI itself will rarely have an issue here. There are no code changes to fix the bug, only actions to restart the app or rebuild.
